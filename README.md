# Dog Mario
In the builds folder, go into the most recent folder and run the .exe files to play the game. Alternatively, you can get the files here https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1fQTHk_lCKCYlVHT3dPYWcxcjA

You can press 1, 2, or 3 to load the respective stages if you cannot handle the full experience of the game :)

The suggested resolution settings are 1024x768, on Good or above. Playing on other resolutions will make the experience of playing Stage 2 less enjoyable.
