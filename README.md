# Dog Mario
In the builds folder, go into the most recent folder and run the .exe files to play the game. Alternatively, you can get the files here https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1fQTHk_lCKCYlVHT3dPYWcxcjA

Although you can play all 3 stages from the main .exe file, the other stages have been compiled seperately for those who want to see them without playing through the earlier stages :)

The suggested resolution settings are 1024x768, on Good or above. We will optimize the game for other resolutions in the future.
