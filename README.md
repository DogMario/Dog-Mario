To play from the git link, you will need Unity (for now. we will add .exe standalone versions here subsequently)

To access the .exe files previously compiled, you can download the .zip files from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1fQTHk_lCKCYlVHT3dPYWcxcjA

From the .zip file, run the .exe inside. The suggested resolution settings are 1024x768, on Good or above
