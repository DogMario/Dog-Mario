In the builds folder, go into the most recent folder and run the .exe files to play the game. Alternatively, you can get the files here https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1fQTHk_lCKCYlVHT3dPYWcxcjA

Although you can play all the stages from the main .exe file, the other stages have been compiled seperately for those who want to see them without playing through the earlier stages :)

The suggested resolution settings are 1024x768, on Good or above. Playing on other resolutions will make the experience of playing Stage 2 less enjoyable.
